        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ezra Cheruiyot, a dedicated Geospatial Information Science and Remote Sensing specialist with a BSc in Geospatial Information Science and Remote Sensing. I have a strong passion for GIS, remote sensing, coding, spatial data analysis, and environmental modeling.

            My expertise includes working with geospatial technologies such as ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Earth Engine, and Python for spatial analysis and automation. I also have experience in LiDAR data processing, satellite imagery analysis, web mapping, and machine learning applications in geospatial science.
            
            I enjoy exploring how geospatial technology can solve real-world challenges, from urban planning and environmental monitoring to disaster management and resource mapping. Always eager to learn and innovate, I'm committed to using GIS and remote sensing to make meaningful contributions in the field....</p>
